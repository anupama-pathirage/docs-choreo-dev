# Create and Publish Your First API

Choreoâ€™s API management capabilities allow you to create, publish, and manage all aspects of an API and its lifecycle.
This quick start guide walks you through the steps to quickly create and publish an API using Choreo. 

## Prerequisites:
- A mock REST services to use when creating the API. 
    
    !!!note
        In this quick start guide, let's use the mock service [http://www.mocky.io/v2/5185415ba171ea3a00704eed](http://www.mocky.io/v2/5185415ba171ea3a00704eed) that is made available by [https://www.mocky.io/](https://www.mocky.io/). Click the mock service URL to test the service. You can see the following JSON message:`{"hello": "world"}`
 
## Step 1: Create an API from scratch
Follow the procedure below to create an API using the mock REST service you tested in the prerequisites section:

1. Access the Choreo Console via [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev/).
2. Sign in using either your GitHub or Google credentials.
3. Go to the **APIs** card and click **Get Started**. This takes you to the **Create API** page. 
    
    !!!note
        If this is not the first API you are creating, you must click **+ Create** to go to the **Create API** page.

4. On the **Create API** page, go to the **Start from scratch card** and click **Next**.
5. In the **Create API from REST API** form, fill in the details as follows:
    - **API Name**: `HelloWorld`
    - **API Version**: `1.0.0`
    - **Endpoint**: http://www.mocky.io/v2/5185415ba171ea3a00704eed
6. Click **Create**. This displays an overview of the API.

7. Under **API Configuration**, click **Resources**.
8. Follow the procedure below to add a resource to the API:
    1. Select `GET` as the HTTP verb.
    2. Enter `hello` as the URI pattern.
    3. Click the **+** icon to add the resource.
    4. Click **Save**. You can see a confirmation message to proceed with the changes.
    5. Click **Save** to proceed.

Now you have created the API and added a GET resource to it.

## Step 2: Deploy the API
Follow the procedure below to create a revision of the API and deploy it:

1. Click **Deploy** in the left pane.
2. On the **Deployments** page, click **Create Revision and Deploy**.
3. In the **Create Revision and Deploy** form, enter `Demo revision` as the description and then click **Deploy**.

Now you are ready to test the deployed API.

## Step 3: Test the API
Follow the procedure below to test the API revision that you deployed:

1. Click **Test** in the left pane.
2. Click on the `GET` resource you added to expand it.

Now you are ready to publish the API to the Choreo Devportal so that external consumers can consume the API.

## Step 4: Publish the API
Follow the procedure below to publish the API and view the published API on the Choreo Devportal:

1. Click **Publish** in the left pane.
2. On the **Lifecycle Management** page, click **Publish**.
